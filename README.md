# Password-Generator



Created this random password generator to help people create better and safer passwords for protecting their accounts. 

The only aspect I hope to update in the future is that currently when you enter letters (e.g. "eight") instead of numbers, I haven't updated it 
to default the option. 

Below is a screenshot of the website currently:
